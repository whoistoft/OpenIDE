# OpenIDE
**Bare, open source Python IDE I made quite a while ago.**
OpenIDE, originally publically available on [my Itch.io page](http://toftdev.itch.io), is a bare bones open source Python IDE built in [Python](http://python.org). Using PyQt5, it builds a GUI that allows the user to enter (non highlighted) code into the IDE, and responds with the bare output. Errors are well handled and outputted cleanly. The IDE runs the code extremely fast as there are no MitM processes that interfere with the efficiency.
